<h2>You can always count on me when...</h2>
<p>I am shy but I take a lot of distance from things and I think a lot, all the time.
I am also a good listener. If you have any problems (professional, private etc...) I will listen.</br>
I love to learn new things.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I was a terrible child but now everything is fine (most of the time).</p>
